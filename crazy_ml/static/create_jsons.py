	at ECS and President of IEEE Biometrics Council. His talks \
	are always something to behold and he's well known for his \
	great teaching style. In this talk, perfect for MSc, 4th and \
	3rd year students, Prof. Nixon will offer an in-depth look at \
	the cutting-edge Biometrics technology research: A future for \
	biometrics - where will identity science go? It is time to take stock and address what is the future of biometrics. Some biometrics are considered to be a solved problem, whilst some remain in the research phase. Some of the ramifications have yet to be explored further. Drawing on my long experience in biometrics, since 1984 before it was even so named, I shall discuss where biometrics is and where it is going. What indeed is the Future of Biometrics?",
