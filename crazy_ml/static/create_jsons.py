	at ECS and President of IEEE Biometrics Council. His talks \
	are always something to behold and he's well known for his \
	great teaching style. In this talk, perfect for MSc, 4th and \
	3rd year students, Prof. Nixon will offer an in-depth look at \
	the cutting-edge Biometrics technology research: A future for \
	biometrics - where will identity science go? It is time to take stock and address what is the future of biometrics. Some biometrics are considered to be a solved problem, whilst some remain in the research phase. Some of the ramifications have yet to be explored further. Drawing on my long experience in biometrics, since 1984 before it was even so named, I shall discuss where biometrics is and where it is going. What indeed is the Future of Biometrics?",

If you enter a team representing ECSS (we can enter as many ECSS teams as we like!) and win the ISC, you get to keep Â£200 of the winnings, with the remaining Â£300 going into the society budget that allows us to run our events. The Qualifier Round takes place in early February after exams, with an entry fee of Â£1 per person. After this stage, successful teams are put through to the Knockout Rounds (played on the buzzer) with a Â£1.50 entry fee per person. ",

    Lifting The Lid: Ongoing Adventures in Pseudoscience. The talk will begin at 7.30pm.\
    Itâs easy to think of pseudoscience existing in a glass case at a museum â something\
    to be examined and critiqued from a safe distance, but not something to touch and to play\
    with. Using examples taken from his own personal experiences in skepticism, Michael Marshall\
    will show what happens when you begin to crack the surface of the pseudosciences that surround\
    us â revealing the surprising, sometimes-shocking and often-comic adventures that lie beneath.\
    Michael Marshall is the Project Director of the Good Thinking Society and the Vice President of\
    the Merseyside Skeptics Society. He regularly speaks with proponents of pseudoscience for the Be\
    Reasonable podcast. His work has seen him organising international homeopathy protests and co-founding\
