	at ECS and President of IEEE Biometrics Council. His talks \
	are always something to behold and he's well known for his \
	great teaching style. In this talk, perfect for MSc, 4th and \
	3rd year students, Prof. Nixon will offer an in-depth look at \
	the cutting-edge Biometrics technology research: A future for \
	biometrics - where will identity science go? It is time to take stock and address what is the future of biometrics. Some biometrics are considered to be a solved problem, whilst some remain in the research phase. Some of the ramifications have yet to be explored further. Drawing on my long experience in biometrics, since 1984 before it was even so named, I shall discuss where biometrics is and where it is going. What indeed is the Future of Biometrics?",

If you enter a team representing ECSS (we can enter as many ECSS teams as we like!) and win the ISC, you get to keep Â£200 of the winnings, with the remaining Â£300 going into the society budget that allows us to run our events. The Qualifier Round takes place in early February after exams, with an entry fee of Â£1 per person. After this stage, successful teams are put through to the Knockout Rounds (played on the buzzer) with a Â£1.50 entry fee per person. ",

Please feel welcome to bring friends, but non-ECS students will not be able to get a drink token. The union bars will be open as usual if you wish to buy more drinks and we'll be heading to Portswood when the night ends to continue the party! We look forward to seeing you there for a night of festivity and celebration to close out 2017 :)",

There will also be a Q&A session, where you'll be able to voice your suggestions about how the society, and our events, are ran. From 8pm, we'll be transitioning to our usual games night in rooms 1065 and 1025 (in the same building), so pop along, play some games and eat some pizza!
