"{\"id\": 1, \"title\": \"TPP Code Quiz\", \"description\": \"Wouldn't pub quizzes be amazing if the questions were all coding challenges? Wouldn't it be even better if you were fed and watered for free? We are excited to announce a Code Quiz at Bar 2 of the Student's Union on Wednesday 7th March, in collaboration with TPP! Unlike a typical pub quiz, you'll need to exercise your problem solving skills to tackle the range of challenges set instead of applying your general knowledge. There will be free food and drinks, both soft and alcoholic, available for attendees throughout the whole event. There will also be great prizes on offer for the winning teams (Raspberry Pi computers and a Hotel Chocolat hamper).\", \"category\": [\"academic\", \"hobbies\", \"contests\"], \"tags\": [\"free\", \"food\", \"alcohol\"], \"start_date\": \"07-03-2018 17:30\", \"end_date\": \"07-03-2018 22:00\", \"place\": \"Union Southampton\", \"organisers\": [\"ECSS\", \"TPP Careers\"], \"web_link\": \"https://www.facebook.com/events/1944840719163622/\", \"tickets_link\": \"\"}"
