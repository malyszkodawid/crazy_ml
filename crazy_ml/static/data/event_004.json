Oli Deakin, Snowflake Software's Principal Software Developer, will talk about how Snowflake is using containerised micro-services to solve one of Aviation's most significant problems. Focusing on a recent deployment at the UAE's air traffic control centre, the talk will introduce the problem being solved, and then discuss Snowflake's solution approach and the technologies involved. Over 25% of Snowflake's UK workforce is made up of ECS graduates, and they're always looking for fresh local talent! This is a great opportunity to network with a Southampton based company, don't miss out!\", \"category\": [\"academic\"], \"tags\": [\"on_campus\", \"free\", \"talk\", \"food\"], \"start_date\": \"27-02-2018 18:00\", \"end_date\": \"27-02-2018 19:00\", \"place\": \"53/4025\", \"organisers\": [\"ECSS\"], \"web_link\": \"https://www.facebook.com/events/167297240727150/\", \"tickets_link\": \"\"}"
