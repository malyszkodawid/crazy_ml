"{\"id\": 7, \"title\": \"OCEAN WAVES\", \"description\": \"You've been asking for it, here it is. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pull out your waviest shirts and garms and join us for a retro-themed boogie in the Disco Room until 4 in the morning! Meet us at The Standing Order on High Street (Wetherspoons = cheap drinks!) for 8:00. We'll be leaving for Oceana at about 10:15 to make sure we all get in before 11:00! By doing so, Oceana will sort us out with booths on arrival and free bottles of vodka for every 10 people! (Make sure you bring your student ID card with ECS visible).\", \"category\": [\"party\"], \"tags\": [\"city_center\", \"dance\", \"alcohol\"], \"start_date\": \"21-02-2018 20:00\", \"end_date\": \"22-02-2018 04:00\", \"place\": \"Oceana Southampton\", \"organisers\": [\"ECSS\"], \"web_link\": \"https://www.facebook.com/events/435010040265227/\", \"tickets_link\": \"\"}"
