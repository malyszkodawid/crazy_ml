"{\"id\": 11, \"title\": \"ECSS Plays Videogames\", \"description\": \"Come along to our second video games social of the year! With access to consoles as well as the lab computers join fellow members of ECS for a night of fun filled gaming. Free pizza as always! Team Fortress 2 will not work on any of the lab computers, but we will be hosting a server for anyone who wants to bring in their own laptop, no VPN required. Battle.net games are working but you need to change the install directory to the root of the C drive. Fortnite will not work as they use their own launcher which is not currently installed or verified on any of the lab computers. A Minecraft server may also be hosted if there is enough interest on the night.\", \"category\": [\"hobbies\"], \"tags\": [\"on_campus\", \"free\", \"food\", \"play\"], \"start_date\": \"08-02-2018 19:00\", \"end_date\": \"08-02-2018 23:00\", \"place\": \"Zepler Level 3\", \"organisers\": [\"ECSS\"], \"web_link\": \"https://www.facebook.com/events/2227753863966386/\", \"tickets_link\": \"\"}"
