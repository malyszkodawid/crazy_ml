"{\"id\": 12, \"title\": \"ECSS White T-Shirt Refreshers Social!\", \"description\": \"Welcome to the ECSS White T-Shirt Social! This is an event we run twice a year and is a great way to meet people. We'll be meeting up in Stag's and then heading down through a number of Portswood's finest establishments throughout the night. The route, though it's subject to change, is Stag's -> Mitre -> Wild Lime -> Gordon Arms/Richmond Inn -> Hobbit -> Jesters/Sobar. If you're not the drinking type, the night usually starts out on the quiet side of things so you're welcome to come along for the start! If you'd like to meet up with us along the way then you're very welcome to, and we'll be posting up our location on this event. Remember to **BRING PENS** so you can draw on people. You can never have enough. You also need student ID to get into Stag's, and legal ID to get into everywhere else! Our white T-shirt social was great fun last semester, so don't miss out!\", \"category\": [\"hobbies\", \"party\"], \"tags\": [\"on_campus\", \"alcohol\"], \"start_date\": \"30-01-2018 19:00\", \"end_date\": \"31-01-2018 01:00\", \"place\": \"The Stag's\", \"organisers\": [\"ECSS\"], \"web_link\": \"https://www.facebook.com/events/139252063423937/\", \"tickets_link\": \"\"}"
