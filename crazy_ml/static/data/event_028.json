"{\"id\": 28, \"title\": \"ECSS at the Inter-Society Challenge!\", \"description\": \"Want to win a quick \\u00a3200 for you and three mates? Southampton's Quiz Society are running the annual Inter-Society Challenge (ISC), a general knowledge quiz tournament with the chance to win big money for the society you represent! The prize money for the winning team is a sweet \\u00a3500. If you enter a team representing ECSS (we can enter as many ECSS teams as we like!) and win the ISC, you get to keep \\u00a3200 of the winnings, with the remaining \\u00a3300 going into the society budget that allows us to run our events. The Qualifier Round takes place in early February after exams, with an entry fee of \\u00a31 per person. After this stage, successful teams are put through to the Knockout Rounds (played on the buzzer) with a \\u00a31.50 entry fee per person. \", \"category\": [\"contests\"], \"tags\": [\"on_campus\", \"free\", \"play\"], \"start_date\": \"13-12-2017 16:00\", \"end_date\": \"18-12-2017 12:00\", \"place\": \"Highfield Campus\", \"organisers\": [\"ECSS\"], \"web_link\": \"https://www.facebook.com/events/163277347758358/\", \"tickets_link\": \"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sryNHdTH3azSTH1rwa7hm8Iph9qaG82iFSd6cYhTr18/viewform?edit_requested=true\"}"
