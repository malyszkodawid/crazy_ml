"{\"id\": 29, \"title\": \"ECS Christmas Party (Free Drink Included!)\", \"description\": \"Join us for our final social of the year: the department christmas party! Our bash this year will be in The Bridge, in the main SUSU building. Entry to the event is free, and the dress code is smart casual and upwards, so dress fancy if you want! Please feel welcome to bring friends, but non-ECS students will not be able to get a drink token. The union bars will be open as usual if you wish to buy more drinks and we'll be heading to Portswood when the night ends to continue the party! We look forward to seeing you there for a night of festivity and celebration to close out 2017 :)\", \"category\": [\"party\"], \"tags\": [\"on_campus\", \"free\", \"dance\", \"alcohol\", \"play\", \"food\"], \"start_date\": \"07-12-2017 18:00\", \"end_date\": \"07-12-2017 23:00\", \"place\": \"The Bridge\", \"organisers\": [\"ECSS\"], \"web_link\": \"https://www.facebook.com/events/360768204344521/\", \"tickets_link\": \"\"}"
