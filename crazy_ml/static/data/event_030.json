"{\"id\": 30, \"title\": \"TGM + Games Night\", \"description\": \"It's time for our TGM (Termly General Meeting), followed by a games night! At 7pm, we'll be holding our TGM. This is a chance to hear about what the committee have been up to so far this term, gain an insight into the growth of the society and this term's cash flow, as well as details about what is in store for the rest of this academic year. There will also be a Q&A session, where you'll be able to voice your suggestions about how the society, and our events, are ran. From 8pm, we'll be transitioning to our usual games night in rooms 1065 and 1025 (in the same building), so pop along, play some games and eat some pizza! Whilst the two events are back-to-back, they are unrelated. You can attend either one, or both!\", \"category\": [\"academic\", \"hobbies\"], \"tags\": [\"on_campus\", \"free\", \"talk\", \"food\", \"play\"], \"start_date\": \"05-12-2017 19:00\", \"end_date\": \"05-12-2017 22:30\", \"place\": \"58/1065\", \"organisers\": [\"ECSS\"], \"web_link\": \"https://www.facebook.com/events/811248419079654/\", \"tickets_link\": \"\"}"
