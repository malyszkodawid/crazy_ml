The talk will begin at 7.30pm.    It\\u2019s easy to think of pseudoscience existing in a glass case at a museum \\u2013 something    to be examined and critiqued from a safe distance, but not something to touch and to play    with. Using examples taken from his own personal experiences in skepticism, Michael Marshall    will show what happens when you begin to crack the surface of the pseudosciences that surround    us \\u2013 revealing the surprising, sometimes-shocking and often-comic adventures that lie beneath.    Michael Marshall is the Project Director of the Good Thinking Society and the Vice President of    the Merseyside Skeptics Society. He regularly speaks with proponents of pseudoscience for the Be    Reasonable podcast. His work has seen him organising international homeopathy protests and co-founding    the popular QED conference. He has written for the Guardian, The Times and New Statesman.\", \"category\": [\"academic\"], \"tags\": [\"on_campus\", \"talk\", \"societies\", \"free\"], \"start_date\": \"05-03-2018 19:00\", \"end_date\": \"05-03-2018 21:00\", \"place\": \"06.1081 (Nuffield Theatre, Lecture Theatre B)\", \"organisers\": [\"Humanist Students Southampton Group\"], \"web_link\": \"\", \"tickets_link\": \"\"}"
