If the idea    of exciting themed camps, fire, fun activities, and a great set of socials appeals    to you then come along and meet lovely (and maybe slightly crazy) people at Southampton    SSAGO! Get involved in activities like archery, climbing and zorbing, trips around the UK,    as well as camps and socials with other SSAGO members all over the country... and that's just the start!\", \"category\": [\"hobbies\"], \"tags\": [\"on_campus\", \"alcohol\", \"societies\"], \"start_date\": \"05-03-2018 20:00\", \"end_date\": \"05-03-2018 23:00\", \"place\": \"The Crown Inn, Highfield\", \"organisers\": [\"Student Scout And Guide Organisation Group\"], \"web_link\": \"\", \"tickets_link\": \"\"}"
